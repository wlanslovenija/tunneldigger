Client Installation
===================

Getting the Source
------------------

Tunneldigger source can be retrieved from its Github repository by running
the following command::

    git clone git://github.com/wlanslovenija/tunneldigger.git

This will give you a ``tunneldigger`` directory which contains the broker and
the client in separate directories. Client code can be compiled into a
stand-alone program.

Requirements
------------

* linux kernel headers

OpenWrt Package
---------------

Currently supported way to compile and deploy a client is through an OpenWrt_
package. Source code for such OpenWrt package can be `found here`_.
